- Reduces documentation-related work
- Offers up-to-date information
- Enhances user experience with warning messages and notifications
- Maintains detailed traveler information
- Sends booking confirmation notifications


## Folder Structure

- src/
  - travel/ # Java source package containing all .java files
  - sql_queries.txt # All SQL queries required for database setup
- bin/
  - travel/ # Compiled .class files matching the src/travel package
- README.md

## Notes
- All **Java source code** is stored inside `src/travel/`.  
- Compiled **bytecode (.class)** files are automatically placed in `bin/travel/`.  
- Ensure that **mysql-connector.jar**  is included in your classpath while compiling or running the project.  
- The file **sql_queries.txt** (in `src/`) contains all SQL statements needed to create and initialize the project database.
